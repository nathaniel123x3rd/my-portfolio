# Security Policy

## 1. Overview

This `SECURITY.md` outlines the security policies for the [Nathaniel's Portfolio](https://github.com/nathaniel123x3rd/nathaniel123x3rd.github.io) repository. It is intended to ensure that any security vulnerabilities are reported responsibly and addressed promptly. By following this policy, we aim to protect users and contributors from risks associated with using the Project.

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly** until it has been addressed.
2. **Email a detailed report** to email@nathaniel.world with the subject line: "Security Vulnerability in [Nathaniel's Portfolio]".
   - Include a description of the vulnerability.
   - Provide steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Attach any relevant proof-of-concept code or screenshots.
3. **Expect an acknowledgment** within 48 hours, including an estimated time frame for resolution.

## 3. Supported Versions

Security updates will be provided for the following versions of this project:

- **Current Stable Release**: Actively supported for all critical and high severity vulnerabilities.
- **Previous Release**: Supported for high severity vulnerabilities only.
- **Older Releases**: Not supported for security updates. Users are advised to upgrade to a supported version.

## 4. Vulnerability Severity Ratings

We categorize vulnerabilities into four severity levels to prioritize their resolution:

- **Critical**: Issues that allow remote code execution, privilege escalation, or access to sensitive data. These are addressed with the highest priority.
- **High**: Issues that could allow unauthorized access or data modification but do not directly lead to a full compromise. These will be fixed as soon as possible.
- **Medium**: Issues that may cause a partial compromise or degrade the user experience but are not immediately exploitable. These will be fixed in regular maintenance releases.
- **Low**: Minor issues that do not affect security significantly but could be exploited under specific circumstances. These will be fixed at the discretion of the maintainers.

## 5. Security Patching Process

Upon receiving a report of a potential security vulnerability, we follow these steps:

1. **Verification**: We will verify the validity of the reported vulnerability using the provided proof-of-concept.
2. **Assessment**: Determine the severity level of the vulnerability and assess the potential impact on users.
3. **Internal Fixing**: Work on a patch in a private branch to ensure the issue is resolved.
4. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the patch to ensure that it fixes the vulnerability without introducing new issues.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the fix to the main branch and tag a new release if necessary.
6. **Notification**: Inform the reporter about the patch and credit them for their responsible disclosure (if they wish to be acknowledged).
7. **Public Disclosure**: After deploying the patch, publicly disclose the vulnerability in the `SECURITY.md` and release notes, including a summary of the issue and its resolution.

## 6. Best Practices for Users

To minimize security risks when using this project, users are encouraged to:

- **Keep the project up-to-date**: Regularly check for new releases and updates.
- **Use HTTPS**: When accessing any resources related to the Project, ensure you use HTTPS to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Report suspicious activities**: If you notice any unusual or suspicious behavior when using this Project, report it immediately to email@nathaniel.world.
- **Use strong passwords**: Ensure that any passwords or credentials used with this Project are complex and unique.

## 7. Security Hardening Recommendations

For users deploying this project on their own servers or platforms, the following measures can help enhance security:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Configure a CSP in your web server to restrict resources that can be loaded on the site.
2. **Secure Headers**: Add security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-XSS-Protection` in your server configuration.
3. **Encryption**: Use TLS/SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted between your server and clients.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) where applicable.
5. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to protect against SQL Injection, XSS, and other input-based attacks.
6. **Server Hardening**: Regularly update server software, disable unnecessary services, and ensure firewall rules are properly configured.

## 8. Disclosure Policy

After a vulnerability has been fixed, we will disclose it publicly under the following conditions:

1. **Non-Critical Vulnerabilities**: Disclosed within 14 days after the patch is released.
2. **Critical and High Severity Vulnerabilities**: Disclosed after a majority of users have had an opportunity to apply the patch, typically 7 days after release.
3. **Acknowledgments**: We will acknowledge security researchers who report vulnerabilities if they agree to be publicly credited.

## 9. Contact Information

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding the security of this Project, please contact:

- **Email**: email@nathaniel.world
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-sensitive security questions, you can also use the Issues tab in the repository.

## 11. Future Improvements

We are committed to continuously improving the security of this Project. Upcoming enhancements include:

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrating tools like GitHub's Dependabot to automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Periodically conducting internal security audits of the codebase.
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Planning to introduce a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
